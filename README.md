# Dictionary App List App with Django

## Introduction

This project is a Django dictionary application made using PyDictionary module as a way for me to build upon and improve my understanding of the Django web framework. It uses the PyDictionary module API to call the users search term, and then displays the words meaning as well as its synonyms and antonyms. I then deployed it to Heroku for the app to be hosted with a database in cloud storage. You can check out the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/), [Foundation 6 Documentation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and the [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) for more information.
