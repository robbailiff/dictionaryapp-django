# Dictionary App List App with Django

## Introduction

This project is a Django dictionary application made using PyDictionary module as a way for me to build upon and improve my understanding of the Django web framework. It uses the PyDictionary module API to call the users search term, and then displays the words meaning as well as its synonyms and antonyms. I then deployed it to Heroku using GitHub for the app to be hosted in cloud storage. You can check out the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/), [Foundation 6 Documentation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and the [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) for more information.

## What did I learn?

For this project, as data was being returned from the API and needed rendering to the pages, I decided to learn more about Django's template language to make the pages more dynamic. This worked out well and I thought the in-built template language had most of the functionality I wanted and was very similar syntactically to Nunjucks. I chose to learn a new CSS framework with this being the first time I have used Foundation. The class names were inituative and it was very well documented with tutorial videos for most of the major features. I quite liked it but it was a bit more advanced than frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma and consequently wasn't as easy to use. It's styling made heavy use of Sass (a tool I currently do not know) which meant most of the features weren't something I could implement without going off on a tangent to try and learn it. I also decided to deploy the app to Heroku via GitHub rather than the Heroku Git CLI to make it easier to uplod the code and the project visible on my GitHub page.
